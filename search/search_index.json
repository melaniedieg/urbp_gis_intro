Natural Breaks is typically appropriate because it takes into account the statistical distribution of your data. Quantile will divide your data into five equal classes. Standard deviation assumes your data is normally distributed and will show symbolization relative to the distance away from the mean of the data. Depending on what you want to show you may also want to set the breaks manually as well. For more finished work you will want to give some thought to your classification method in relation to the objective of your map, and make sure you have a legend with the breaks available.</p> <p>We also see the option for Normalization, which divides the data by that field. This could be useful if you wanted to symbolize population in relation to area, or total cases of something per the population.</p> <p>With polygon fields we can also use the dot density scheme.
