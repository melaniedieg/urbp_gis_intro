I would recommend making the window fullscreen. </p> <p>Depending on your starting point, you can either continue working on existing work by downloading the working files from dropbox, or, if starting a new project - I would recommend setting up a working folder on the U drive. Remember, any additional files you want to download/accessing your dropbox in the browser, must be done in the browser within Apporto (this is easier if window is full screen).</p> <p></p> <p>If you are continuing previous work, you will navigate to your dropbox in the browser. </p> <p></p> <p>This is why folder organization can come in handy, because all the input files associated with a specific project (shps, csvs, etc.) will be stored in the same place, in addition to the .aprx file (opens the map) and all other various outputs in default geodatabase.</p> <p>For example, if I wanted to continue working on class_2_demo, a working folder I had backed up in its entirely from a lab computer - I can simply download the entire folder to my U drive in the Apporto environment. It will zip the entire working folder.</p> <p></p> <p>After extracting, you will have a working environment that looks familiar. Remember we can just double click the .aprx file (has map icon) and it will fire up the map in ArcGIS Pro, as well as maintain the connection to all source files. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>To save the current work and back up again (same directions apply for work you are doing on a lab computer and want to back up to dropbox), make sure you save and close your map. We need to close the map before we back up any files to ensure none of the files have locks on them. Back in dropbox, under your folder for the course, select upload, and folder.

My first move would be to check out the files in Windows Explorer to ensure they are actually in the folder you think they are/the folder you connected to in Pro.

My third move would be to reconnect to the correct folder if something went wrong during the linking process.</p> <p>Remember it's not big deal to connect to a different folder, we will often have to do so as we work with more data. The point of connecting to your working folder at the beginning is to keep your inputs and outputs for a particular assignment in one place.
